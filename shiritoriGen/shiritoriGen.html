	<h1> shiritori poem generator </h1>
	<p>this program starts with a random word from a block of text, finds a word that starts with the last letter of the first word, and so on, until there are no remaining words that fit the criteria. It will then produce a body of text consisting of all of the selected words. This is based off of the traditional Japanese game called "shiritori".</p>

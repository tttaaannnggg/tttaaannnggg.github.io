            This project was a fun one! I'd been able to solve JS algorithms of
            a similar complexity before, but never had to actually make it
            interface with the DOM. Some of the ways I'm dealing with scope are
            suspect (there are a few globals floating around that I need to
            clean up later), but I'm proud of myself for finding a (semi)
            practical use for recursion!

            This is not quite as complex as the shiritoriGen, but I cleaned up a
            lot of the nonsense and tried my best to work using functional
            programming strategies. The only places where side effects happen
            are that I'm mutating my textArr (which doesn't matter b/c it's
            initialized in the scope of orderByLength anyways), and I'm using a
            p tag as an output to render the final result. Everything else just
            passes return values from one function to another. I could probably
            reduce time complexity, or use built-in methods for some of the
            stuff I'm doing (I wrote my own function to flatten an array, which
            I probably didn't have to do), but I'm prety happy with how it works
            for now.
